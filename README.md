# Runet

The purpose of creating Runet is to learn the modern networking stack by building a fully functional web server with relatively low level programming interfaces. It documents the fundamental concepts in networking to introduce the core domain knowledge, and it demonstrates how network programming is done in practice. Rust is the chosen language for this project, but the focus is on implementing networking features rather than introducing Rust.
